# Purchase-Pattern-Analysis

The Purchase Pattern Analysis project focuses on understanding customer buying behavior to uncover frequently purchased product combinations. ðŸ›’ Using Python and libraries like pandas, I applied the FP-Growth algorithm to perform market basket analysis and identify items that often get bought together.

The goal was to help businesses improve their product bundling strategies, increase sales revenue, and enhance customer satisfaction by offering better deals and personalized recommendations. ðŸ“Š I also visualized key insights to show which products drive the most sales and which categories have the highest co-occurrence rates.

This project was a fantastic way to explore real-world purchasing patterns and see how data-driven insights can help businesses grow!
